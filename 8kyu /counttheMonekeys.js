//You take your to the forest to see the monkeys. You know that there are a certain number there(n), but your son is too young 
// to just appreciate the full number, he has to start counting them from 1. 

// As a good parent, you will sit and count with him. Given the number(n), populate an array with all numbers 
// upto and including that number, but excluding zero. 

// For example: 
// monkeyCount(10) // --> [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
// monkeyCount(1) // --> [1]

function monkeyCount(n) {
    var arr = [];
    for(var i = 1; i <= n; i++)arguments.push(i);
    return ar;
